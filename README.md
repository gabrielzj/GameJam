## GameJam 游눹: 
2D Game developed on the UTFPR GameJam, using Unity.
## Rules
1. The game must be developed using a game engine.
2. The game theme must be related to Fear.
3. The game must have an item: "the source" (will be explained).
4. The competition time limit is 24 hours, meaning there is no extra time.
## Concept 游눠
Your player is a colorful circle. You are trapped in a maze in complete darkness and can only see a small area around you. Your goal is to find the special item, the "source," and the exit. There are a few collectibles that can give you temporary buffs or debuffs
